# Thesis Second Round Coding Challenge

## *Project Overview*

This is a second round coding challenge I completed in connection with my Front-End Developer application for Thesis.  

The challenge itself involved creating a sample landing page for a fictional company ("Stamp") that incorporated reponsiveness, performance (especially page load time), & the proper use of stateful psuedo-classes (e.g. hover, focus, etc.).

The Figma file I used as the basis for my code ("Frontend Dev Sample.fig") looked like this:
